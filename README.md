# Flac2mp3

I downloaded some music that came in `.flac` files. My mp3 player / phone doesn't like `.flac`, so this is a program to batch-convert flac files in a folder to mp3..

## Usage

Clone repo and make a bash alias to the shell script. Call the alias with a directory as a single argument

`flac2mp3 "folder with flac files/"`

it will create a "folder with flac files/em-pee-three/" directory and all the flac files will appear there in mp3 versions.
